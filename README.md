# IMDB_Analysis (Movie Ratings Analysis)
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company that has produced many super-hit movies. The company has generally released movies for the Indian audience, but they plan to release a movie for the global audience in 2022. The production company wants to plan every move analytically based on data and has approached you for help with this new project. I have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past 3 years. I have to analyze the data set and draw meaningful insights to help the company start its new project.
Check the code file, and I have provided the dataset but the database is huge so you won't be able to see it until you click on the view raw link display on the dataset SQL file.
